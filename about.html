<h2 class="aboutheading">We believe in <em>home cooking.</em></h2>

<p class="pstats"><em>One of the oldest occupations ever,</em>
<br> cooking has been at the heart of the community since prehistoric times. 
<br>
Less than 2/10 people claim to have a strong passion for cooking in the west nowadays:</p>

<ul class="stats">

<li>According to a 2022 study, only 13.7% of the Americans surveyed prepare their meals at home because of a strong <a href="https://www.reportlinker.com/clp/global/793">passion</a> for cooking.</li>

<li>According to statistics, UK citizens reluctantly spend time in the kitchen as takeout app orders have <a href="https://transact.ft.com/the-kitchen/">tripled</a> between 2013 and 2018. </li>

<li>The food delivery sales market could increase from $35bn today to $365bn by <a href="https://transact.ft.com/the-kitchen/ ">2030.</a> That’s a compound annual growth rate of more than 20%. </li>

</ul>

<h2 class="aboutheading">We believe everyone has <em>the right to good food.</em></h2>

<p class="pstats"><em>Now, you might be going</em>
<br> "Great news! I love eating out." <em>And so do we!</em>
<br>But we're also like "wait, will I be able to afford takeaways every day?"</p>


<ul class="stats">
<li>On average, eating out is 5 times more expensive than cooking the same meal <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/consumer-expenditures/2015/pdf/home.pdf 
">home.</a></li>

<li>According to Trading Economics, food inflation in the United Kingdom <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/inflation-cpi">increased to 19.1 percent</a> year-on-year in March 2023.</li>


<li>In the case of community college students and cooking, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/06/new-study-finds-that-36-percent-of-college-students-dont-have-enough-to-eat.html">statistics</a> indicate that 42% are “food insecure.” </li>

<li>10% U.K. adults live in food insecure households and another 10% live with moderate to severe food insecurity acording to <a href="https://enuf.org.uk/ ">ENUF</a></li>	
</ul>


<h2 class="aboutheading">Call us old fashioned, but <em>we do care about health.</em></h2>

<p class="pstats">A growing body of scientific evidence says people who frequently cook meals at home are <em>healthier</em> and consume <em>fewer calories.</em></p>


<ul class="stats">
<li>Studies ran by The John Hopkins Public Health School found that showing patients how to cook meals at home could be <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25076113/
">as an effective medical intervention.</a></li>

<li>Another study claims that home cooking <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/home-cooking-good-for-your-health-2018081514449"> has been shown to improve diet quality, weight loss, and diabetes prevention home.</a></li>

<li>But as opposed to what? Well, most ready meals from supermarkets along with meals from full-service restaurants have an additional of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10574515/">205 calories, 2.5 grams of saturated fat, and 451 milligrams of sodium.</a>Compared to home cooked meals, they also contain <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412017314666">35% more phthalate.</a>
</li>	

<li>But we shouldn't blame ourselves if we're not so eager to cook. According to <a href="https://foodfoundation.org.uk/publication/veg-facts-2016">Food Foundation</a> 1.2% of advertising spend each year goes on vegetables, yet 22% is spent on confectionery, cakes, biscuits and ice cream. Also, it's <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4190277/">three times more expensive to get the energy we need from healthy foods</a> than unhealthy foods.</li>	
</ul>



<h2 class="aboutheading">We believe cooking means <em>thinking about the future.</em></h2>

<p class="pstats">70% of US consumers agree that food/drink companies can be <em>leaders in protecting the environment.</em>
<br> We believe the same, so we're not even gonna try to make you feel responsible for that. However, there are a few more things about the food supply that you might want to be aware of in the future. </p>


<ul class="stats">


<li>By now you probably heard about ethical sourcing - ie. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/agriculture-in-the-united-kingdom-2021/chapter-7-crops#fresh-vegetables">cooking what's in season and in the proximity.</a>
</li>

<li>The World Food Programme reports that Russia and Ukraine combined account for just under <a href="https://www.mintel.com/food-and-drink-market-news/the-future-of-food-production-learning-from-nature-to-become-less-dependent-on-oil-and-imports/">30% of global wheat exports</a> and the Observatory of Economic Complexity states that in peacetime, <a href="https://www.mintel.com/food-and-drink-market-news/the-future-of-food-production-learning-from-nature-to-become-less-dependent-on-oil-and-imports/">Ukraine alone produces 13% of global corn and 45% of global crude sunflower seed oil exports.</a></li>

<li>People are not often aware of these facts. <a href="https://www.mintel.com/consumer-sustainability-barometer">Just 28% of the consumers surveyed across 16 countries cited ‘food shortages due to drought or crop failure’ as one of their top five environmental concerns.</a> By way of comparison, 52% opted for plastic pollution. Whilst the current disruption to food production in Ukraine is the result of military intervention rather than environmental factors, it presents a likely forecast of the more frequent climatic system pressures to come, with peacetime harvests in the breadbaskets of the world increasingly likely to be impacted by drought.
